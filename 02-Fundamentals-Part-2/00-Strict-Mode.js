// LECTURE 32     ACTIVATING Strict MODE
//------------------------------------------------

// â­• Scrict Mode is a special mode in javascript that helps us to write more secure code in Javascript. It should be the first script in the js file. It helps to avoid introducing accidental BUGS in our code. This is how its written and USE IT EVERYTIME

// "use strict";

// Reasons to use strict mode

// 1. It forbids us to do certain things
// 2. It creates visbile errors in developer console which would go un-noticed by javascript if we do not use it

// Another thing that strict mode does is to introduce a short list of variable names that are reserved for features that might be added to the language a bit later. For Example

// RESERVED WORDS (or to be Reserved in future releases)

//--------------------------
// const interface = "Audio";
// const private = 234;
// const if = 1;
